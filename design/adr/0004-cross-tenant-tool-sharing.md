# ADR-0004: Cross-tenant tool sharing

- **Status**: Pending (Open)
- **Date**: 2026-07-17
- **Suggested by**: OpenStrata Architecture Group
- **Repository**: ai-tool-registry
- **Source**: `design/DESIGN.md` §14 Open Issue
- **Association**: (within this repository)

##Context

Are platform-level public tools (such as weather queries) allowed to be visible across tenants? Requires RBAC model extensions.

## Decision Options (Options Considered)

1. **Maintain status quo / conservative default**: Maintain current behavior, controlled by configuration switches or explicit parameters, and do not introduce destructive changes.
2. **Unified implementation after cross-repository alignment**: Agree on a clear contract with the relevant service (`corresponding governance service`) before implementation.
3. **Phased introduction**: Leave a placeholder/default switch in the current stage, and solidify it in subsequent stages after the dependent capabilities are ready (see Related Architecture §).

## Recommended decision (Decision)

This ADR solidifies "cross-tenant tool sharing" into an architectural decision record and incorporates it into `design/adr/` for continuous tracking. This issue stems from the `design/DESIGN.md` §14 open issue and is still open.

**Conservative Default Principle**: Before the final decision is made, the "minimum available + explicit configuration switch" shall prevail, maintain the current behavior, and not destroy the existing contract and cross-repository SPI interface; this ADR status will be written back after review by the relevant team.



## To be aligned / Follow-ups (Follow-ups)

- Solidify the decision before the review at the corresponding stage, and write the final conclusion back into this ADR (the status is changed from "Pending" to "Adopted").
